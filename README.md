This repository includes the original codes used to create the main figures of this paper: Asynchronous firing and off-states in working memory maintenance (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.12.681904). Run scripts titled as 'Figure1C', 'Figure5', etc. to recreate the corresponding figures. The rest of the scripts are mainly helper functions. The user needs to change the data directory to its local location to successfully run the scripts.
